                 as a long horizontal line of white in his mind. This line later turned
                  into a coral reef among Pacific surges. Then the sailor spotted an outrigger
                   canoe. In the canoe Martin noticed an old man dipping a fishing paddle. This 
                   was Moti, the youngest son of Tati, and the place was called Tahiti. All of a
